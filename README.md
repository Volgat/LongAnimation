> Existing	studies	are	limited	to	short-term	colorization	by	fusing	overlapping	features	to	achieve	smooth	transitions,	which	fails	to maintain	long-term	color	consistency.	In	this	study,	we	propose	a	dynamic	global-local	paradigm	to	achieve	ideal	long-term	color consistency	by	dynamically	extracting	global	color-consistent	features	relevant	to	the	current	generation.

🎉🎉 Our paper, “LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local Memory” accepted by ICCV 2025! Looking forward to seeing you at ICCV then!
**Strongly recommend seeing our [demo page](https://cn-makers.github.io/long_animation_web/).**

## TODO List

- [x] Release the paper and demo page. Visit [https://cn-makers.github.io/long_animation_web/](https://cn-makers.github.io/long_animation_web/) 
- [x] Release the code.


## Requirements
The training is conducted on 6 A100 GPUs (80GB VRAM), the inference is tested on 1 A100 GPU. 
## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/CN-makers/LongAnimation
cd LongAnimation
```

## Environment
All the tests are conducted in Linux. We suggest running our code in Linux. To set up our environment in Linux, please run:
```
conda create -n LongAnimation python=3.10 -y
conda activate LongAnimation

bash install.sh
```


## Checkpoints
1. please download the pre-trained CogVideoX-1.5 I2V  checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V), and put the whole folder under `pretrained_weight`, it should look like `./pretrained_weights/CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V`

2. please download the pre-trained long video understanding model Video-XL  checkpoints from [here](https://huggingface.co/sy1998/Video_XL/tree/main), and put the whole folder under `pretrained_weight`, it should look like `./pretrained_weights/videoxl`

3. please download the checkpoint for our SketchDiT and DGLM model from [here](https://huggingface.co/CNcreator0331/LongAnimation/tree/main), and put the whole folder as `./pretrained_weights/longanimation`.

   



## Generate Your Animation!
To colorize the target lineart sequence with a specific character design, you can run the following command:
```
bash  long_animation_inference.sh
```


We provide some test cases in  `test_json` folder. You can also try our model with your own data. You can change the lineart sequence and corresponding character design in the script `Long_animation_inference.sh`.

During the official training, the --height and --weight we used were 576 and 1024 respectively. Additionally, the model can also be compatible with resolutions of 768 in length and 1360 in width respectively.
